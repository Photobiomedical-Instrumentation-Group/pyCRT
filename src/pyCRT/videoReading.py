"""
Video reading functionality (pyCRT.videoReading)

This module contains everything directly related to extracting lightly processed data
from video files or cameras, in particular obtaining the arrays with each frame's time
within the video and the average intensities array calculated within a region of
interest of each frame.

Notes
-----
    This module has only been tested with wmv and mp4 files, with WMV2, and DIVX and
    MP4V codecs respectively.

    """
    Extracts the time in seconds of each frame and the average pixel intensities of each
    channel within the region of interest (ROI).

    Parameters
    ----------
    videoSource : int or str
        The first argument to cv2.VideoCapture. If an int, it will take the
        corresponding detected camera as the video source. If a str, It'll take it as a
        path in the filesystem for a video file.

    roi : Tuple[int, int, int, int] or "all"
        The region of interest, inside which the average of each pixel will be computed.
        This tuple must contain 4 integers: (x, y, length_x, and length_y), where x and
        y are the coordinates of the rectangle's center. If roi == "all", then the
        average will be computed on the entire frame. You can also select the ROI at any
        time during the video by pressing the space bar and dragging the square around
        the desired region.

    displayVideo : bool, default=True
        Whether or not to display the video while it is being read. This must be set to
        True if no ROI is specified, so the ROI can be manually selected by pressing the
        spacebar during the video exhibition.

    recordingPath : str, default=None
        The path (with the extension!) in the filesystem wherein to save the recording.
        If falsy, it won't record the video.

    rescaleFactor : real number, optional
        Factor by which each frame will be scaled. This can help reduce the load on the
        hardware and speed up computation. By default the video won't be scaled.

    waitKeyTime : int, optional
        How many milliseconds to wait for user input between each frame. The default
        value is 1, so on most machines the video will appear "sped up" relative to it
        being played on a regular video player. See cv2.waitKey for more information.

    cameraResolution : tuple of 2 ints, default=None
        Used to optionally change the camera resolution before handing over the
        VideoCapture instance. If reading from a video file, it does nothing.

    codecFourcc : str, default='mp4v'
        The fourcc identifier for the video codec to be used for the recording. Refer to
        www.fourcc.org/codecs.php for a list of possible codes.

    recordingFps : float, default=None
        The FPS (frames per second) for the recording, which doesn't need to correspond
        to the FPS of the camera or the source video.

    Returns
    -------
    fullTimeScdsArr : 1D np.ndarray
        Time in seconds of each frame in the video.
    channelsAvgIntensArr : 2D np.ndarray
        Average pixel intensity inside the region of interest with respect to time. It
        is an array with shape (len(fullTimeScdsArr), 3), wherein each element is an
        array with the average intensity of the B, G and R (respectively) channels at
        that instant.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If roi isn't a tuple or a str.
    ValueError
        If roi is a string, but not "all", or isn't a tuple of 4 elements
    RuntimeError
        If this function finished reading the video but no ROI was passed or selected.
