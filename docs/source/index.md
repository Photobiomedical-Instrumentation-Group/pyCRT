# Welcome to pyrCRT's documentation!

PyrCRT is a Python library for measuring capillary refill time (CRT) from videos.

```{note}
Though pyrCRT is pretty much feature-complete and completely documented, the
presentation of this documentation is just a quick draft. I recommend reading
the {doc}`Basic Usage <usage>` and inspecting the documentation as you need to
on iPython or in the source code itself.
