Welcome to pyCRT's documentation!
=================================

PyCRT is a Python library for measuring capillary refill time (CRT). It can
calculate CRT from video files, video cameras and arbitrary arrays of channel
intensities and times, and offers a variety of options related to fine-tuning
the calculation, and tools for visualization, storing and retrieving results,
and basic interactivity.

Users not entirely familiar with pCRT are advised to take a look at our
:doc:`introduction to pCRT <introduction>`, especially to understand the
terminology used throughout this documentation. Users already familiar with
pCRT can go straight to the :doc:`basic usage tutorial <usage>` or to the
:doc:`complete API reference <pyCRT>` if they're looking for detailed
documentation on a specific part of pyCRT .
